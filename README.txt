HOW TO DOWNLOAD.

On github click on the 'Code' and do 'Download ZIP' 
Or you can use this link https://github.com/PortalRex/p2mtriggers/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

There are 4 folders inside of 'p2mtriggers-master'
SP and Coop folders HAVE TO GO INSIDE OF YOUR CFG FOLDER 'Steam\steamapps\common\Portal 2\portal2\cfg'
SP LiveSplit Splits and Coop LiveSplit Splits can go anywhere this is where you will open the splits from

If you have the intention of using the LiveSplit Splits you have to have the sar.asl setup or this will not work.
You can find more about that in the #help channel in the Portal 2 Speedrun Server.

You need to put SPmtriggers.cfg and Coopmtriggers.cfg in your cfg folder.
Along with that please put the lines below in your autoexec.cfg 

exec SPmtriggers.cfg
